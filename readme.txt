=== About MyUPB Forum ===

MyUPB Forum software was first released in 2002, its initials being an acronym of Ultimate Php Board. 
It was written by a small team of software developers working under the banner Php Outburst headed 
by Tim Hoeppner aka Pilot and supported by Jerroyd Moore aka Rebles, and is flat file utilising an 
in-house text base database rather than the then expensive MySQL option used on most forums today. 
It soon became very popular and at its height powered many hundred websites. Other key members 
during this period were Jono345, The Ripper, Codex and Clark, who joined in April 2007.

Although the team continued to expand its features MySQL based forums had become a cheap and 
attractive alternative which lead to a decline in the number of sites using MyUPB. 
In December 2010 v.2.2.7. became available though sadly this has proved to be the last official release.

Progress since then has been slow with the original team retiring from the project leaving just Clark 
who continued to develop the forum with localisation and various other additions until he too left the 
project in May 2014.

With Clark's departure future development of the project to v.2.2.8 is uncertain and there is no longer 
any official support by Clark.

MyUPB is still a great forum package that is ideal for smaller websites that don't require a 'feature rich' 
forum and can be even better providing some of the errors and configuration issues can be corrected.

Ultimate PHP Board is a flat-file forum for anyone who need fast and modern forum without using mySQL.

Now, since may 2014 new group of developers is working on myUPB v.2.2.8. We decided to store code on Github 
where you can see how much work we did since 2.2.7 version.
Some of the new things are:

  * new Captcha (thanks for Cool-php-captcha team)
  * many bugfixes (there is still much to do)
  * html5 and css3 (in 2.2.8 we want to use new technologies)
        partially changed obsolete html tags to new ones (or css)
Todo:
    *fix all errors! :)
    *new skins
    *internationalisation
    *better time (auto time zone and other things)
    *break with old technologies (some parts are still backward compatible with PHP 3 ;)

MyUPB is a forum package that is ideal for smaller websites that don't require a 'feature rich' 
forum and can be even faster than mySQL-based forums.

an warm welcome for all PHP & Ajax as well as Java programmer

best regards
PHP Outburst team :)
